# Product Mission (Lite)

Agent Trust Protocol™ (ATP) is a quantum-safe security protocol that helps enterprise developers and security architects deploy secure AI agents by providing cryptographically secure authentication, dynamic trust scoring, and automated regulatory compliance across multi-protocol agent ecosystems.

ATP serves enterprise developers and security architects who need quantum-safe security for AI agents across multiple protocols. Unlike traditional security protocols that will be vulnerable to quantum attacks, ATP provides quantum-safe security from day one using NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms, while bridging all major agent protocols without requiring protocol changes.
